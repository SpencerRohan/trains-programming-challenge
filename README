TRAINS PROBLEM SOLUTION
=======================

1. Building
The solution is provided in the form of a Maven project. It can
thus be built by invoking the "package" goal so:

  $ mvn package

Note that this goal runs all JUnit tests included in the solution.

When using Eclipse, I recommend simply importing the project via the
File->Import->Existing Maven Project. Select the directory
corresponding to this solution.

2. Running the solution
The solution can be run on the CLI:

  $ java -jar target/graph-challenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar graph-input.txt commands.txt

Note that the sample input and commands files, "graph-input.txt" and
"commands.txt" are provided in the solution. These can be of course modified
as needed. The format of the files is explained by the help screen produced
when the application is run without arguments. Here is a copy of the help
screen:

Usage: <input graph> <commands file>
This application analyzes an input graph as instructed by a series 
of commands. The format of the input files is as follows:
. <input graph>: file containing a comma separated set of graph 
.                connections, where each connection is described 
.                by two letters corresponding to the source and target 
.                node followed by an integer indicating the weight (i.e
.                the "distance") for this route. For example "AC7, CB5")
. <commands file>: file describing the analysis to be performed. Each line
.                  corresponds to one action:
.                  distance? <nodes>: calculates the distance for a given
.                                     route. For example: "distance? ADC"
.                  trips? <cond> <nodes>: calculates the number of possible
.                                         trips between two nodes which satisfy
.                                         a given condition. Conditions are
.                                         expressed with a combination of an
.                                         operator, a value and an entity name
.                                         i.e. ">5 stops" or "=7 distance".
.                                         So for example: "trips? <10 stops EA"
.                                         means "calculate the number of trips
.                                         between E and A which have less than
.                                         10 stops.
.                  shortest? <nodes>:     finds the shortest distance between
.                                         two nodes (i.e. "shortest? AD")



When running the solution from Eclipse, it is necessary to specify the command
line arguments for the application, so in the project properties,
select Run/Debug Settings->App->Edit, select the Arguments tab and specify

  graph-input.txt commands.txt

as program arguments.

Here is an example run of the solution:

$ java -jar target/graph-challenge-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar  graph-input.txt commands.txt
distance? ABC  => 9
distance? AD  => 5
distance? ADC  => 13
distance? AEBCD  => 22
distance? AED  => ROUTE NICHT VORHANDEN
trips? <4 stops CC  => 2
trips? =4 stops AC  => 3
shortest? AC  => 9
shortest? BB  => 9
trips? <30 distance CC  => 7

Note that the application supports German and English locales, so depending on
system settings, reports and errors will be reported on different languages.

3. Approach
The solution to the problem contains 3 different aspects. The commands are read and a given Action object is instantiated to carry on a specific analysis. The 3 main actions are implemented by the following classes:

- DistanceAction : its execute() method simply follows the path as requested by
  the user, recording the distance travelled. If the path specified is not
  possible, the result is "NO SUCH ROUTE".

- TripsAction : when execute()'d , it performs a recursive tree search starting
  on the first node, to find all possible paths that end at the target node,
  which satisfy the given condition. This recursive search is carried on by the
  PathFinder class

- ShortestPathAction: execute() will trigger a run of the Dijkstra algorithm
  to search for the shortest route between the source and the target. It would
  have also been possible to reuse the PathFinder class for this action, and
  after finding all possible paths between the start and target nodes, simply
  iterate thru the paths and select the smallest one. This however, implicates
  selecting an arbitrary maximum number of hops, after which the search for the
  shortest path should be given up. Furthermore it is highly inefficient. So I
  decided to implement the search for the shortest path using the well known
  Dijkstra algorithm.
